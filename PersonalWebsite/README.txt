1. What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?
	The most challenging part of this assignment was ensuring that the layout remained consistent across both desktop and mobile views. While HTML was fairly straightforward, working with CSS required more attention to detail, especially in maintaining a responsive design. It took me around 15 hours in total to complete the entire assignment, with a large portion of that time spent on testing and debugging the mobile-friendly layout.


2. What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
	To make the site mobile-friendly, I implemented media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens. I made the navigation bar collapse into a column on mobile and adjusted font sizes and padding to ensure readability. Additionally, images were set to a flexible width to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring that they looked good without distorting.


3. What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website? Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?
	When designing the website, I focused on simplicity and clarity, ensuring that the navigation was easy to use and the content was well-structured. I considered user experience by choosing a clean color scheme and a readable font. I’m particularly proud of the "Contact" section, where I used a grid layout to organize contact information in a way that remains neat and visually appealing on all devices.


4. Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?
	Given more time, I would add a blog section with an integrated commenting system for better user interaction. I would also like to implement more advanced animations for transitions between pages and sections. Additionally, adding a gallery page to showcase photos or projects in a more dynamic way would be a priority.


5. How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
I spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment, split between designing the layout, writing the content, and ensuring everything worked well across devices.
